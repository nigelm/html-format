     French: h√©t√©rog√©n√©it√©, √ßa a beaucoup
     d'accents.

     Polish: welcome to sunny ≈Å√≥d≈∫.

     Here's how you say "tax return" in Thai:
     ‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏Ñ‡∏∑‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏á‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏µ‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£

     This Mongolian person's twitter username
     character is not a soft-hyphen:
     ·†≠-·†™·†¢·†∞·†¢·†∑·†°·†Ø

     Let us all worship at the shrine of Emoji: how
     else could you throw a pile of poo at a
     snowman?
     Ì†ΩÌ≤© ‚Üí ‚òÉ

     This sentence is full of non-breaking spaces
     but it'll be broken anyway.

     I put a hyphen in
     llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrob
     wllllantysiliogogogoch and it ended up as a
     space.
